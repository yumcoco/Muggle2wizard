### Muggle TO Wizard
Our generator consists of two parts. The user, as a new Muggle student, enters personal information such as name, MBTI, etc. and the aspiration to enroll as a wizard. 
After filling out a questionnaire to test "talent" and rolling the dice to test luck, if the user passes the questionnaire with a score greater than 60, the user will receive exclusive 8-bit style music generated by two generative models and an avatar holding a magic wand assigned by the "college".After obtaining exclusive music and avatars, users will be guided to the sorting ceremony and obtain personal profiles in different house styles, including the name of the wizard, wand, patronus, signature spell and mentor's message.
